# 💳 BNPL Risk Engine

A real-time Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) credit risk scoring system built with **Go** and **Python**, designed to assess default risk using behavioral and contextual signals.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

This engine evaluates BNPL requests and assigns a **risk score**, **risk grade**, and **approval decision**, based on:

- 🛒 **Purchase amount**
- 🚩 **Past fraud reports**
- 🤝 **Social score (trustworthiness or external signals)**

It also provides a clear, explainable summary of **why** a decision was made.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

### Backend (Go)
- Accepts requests at `/bnpl-check`
- Forwards input to a Python ML microservice
- Returns the final result to the client (or frontend)

### ML Engine (Python Flask)
- Simple rule-based model
- Calculates a score out of 100
- Returns decision (`Approved`, `Rejected`, etc.)
- Generates a human-readable explanation

---

## 🧪 Example Input

```json
POST /bnpl-check
{
  "purchase_amount": 850,
  "past_fraud_reports": 1,
  "social_score": 75
}
````

### ✅ Example Output

```json
{
  "score": 55,
  "grade": "Medium",
  "decision": "Approved with caution",
  "explanation": "Moderately high purchase amount increased the risk. 1 past fraud report(s) added significant risk. Average social trust score had neutral impact."
}
```

## 📦 Run Locally

### 1. Start the Python ML Engine

```bash
python risk_engine.py
# Runs on http://localhost:5001
```

### 2. Start the Go Backend

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
# Runs on http://localhost:8080
```

## 📈 What's Next?

* Add MongoDB to log decisions and build analytics
* Add OpenAI to auto-generate decision explanations
* Build a React UI for real-time user input
* Deploy with Render / Railway / Vercel

## 📌 Why This Project?

BNPL is exploding in the GCC and MENA region, but most providers lack **real-time, explainable risk scoring** tailored to young, digital-first users. This project addresses that gap — and shows what a Gen Z-native fintech API could look like.
